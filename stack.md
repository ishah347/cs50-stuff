## Questions

3.1. _init_ is used in class instantiation. Specifically, when defined, its role is to declare and specify the initial conditions of
a class object that it has when it is called/instantiated. Without _init_, the object called would automatically be empty.

3.2. See `parser.py`.

3.3. It is called when the compiler comes across a start tag that often precedes content, which includes its tagname and attributes contained within "<" and ">".

3.4. It is called when the compiler comes across an end tag that often follows content, which includes its tagname preceded by a forward slash contained within
"<" and ">".

3.5. See `parser.py`.
